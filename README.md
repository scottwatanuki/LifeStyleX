# LifeStyleX

LifeStyleX is a command-line tool that creates a personalized lifestyle schedule based on a user's sleep chronotype. It determines the user's chronotype through a quiz and provides an ideal schedule for their sleep and daily activities.

## How It Works

LifeStyleX asks the user a series of questions to assess their sleep preferences and habits. The questions are extracted from [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7qCF461WPA). Based on the user's answers, LifeStyleX categorizes them into one of the four scientifically proven chronotypes: bear, lion, wolf, or dolphin.

Each chronotype has a specific schedule that aligns with their natural sleep patterns and productivity levels. LifeStyleX generates and displays the ideal schedule for the user's chronotype, helping them optimize their daily routine.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to express gratitude to all its users for their support and feedback, which have contributed to the improvement and development of this tool.

Thank you for using LifeStyleX! I hope it helps you optimize your sleep schedule and achieve your goals.
