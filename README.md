# LifeStyleX
LifeStyleX is a command-line tool that creates a personalized lifestyle schedule by determining a user's sleep chronotype.

According to Sleep Foundation, a chronotype is “the natural inclination of your body to sleep at a certain time, or what most people understand as being an early bird versus a night owl. In addition to regulating sleep and wake times, chronotype has an influence on appetite, exercise, and core body temperature. It is responsible for the fact that you feel more alert at certain periods of the day and sleepier at others.”
